Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in code and coordinate work among multiple developers. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become the standard for version control in software development.

\subsection{Key Concepts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Version Control:} Git allows developers to keep track of changes to their codebase over time. Each change is recorded as a commit, which represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
    
    \item \textbf{Repositories:} A Git repository (repo) is a collection of files and directories that are tracked by Git. It contains the entire history of the project, including all commits and branches.
    
    \item \textbf{Commits:} A commit is a record of changes to the repository. It includes a unique identifier (commit hash), a commit message describing the changes, and the author's information. Commits are organized in a linear sequence, forming a commit history.
    
    \item \textbf{Branches:} Git allows developers to create separate branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches provide isolation and allow for parallel development. The main branch, typically named "master" or "main", represents the stable version of the project.
    
    \item \textbf{Merging:} Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. Git uses merge commits to integrate changes and resolve any conflicts that may arise.
    
    \item \textbf{Remote Repositories:} Git enables collaboration among multiple developers by allowing them to share their repositories with others over the internet. Remote repositories serve as a central location for storing and exchanging code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic Workflow}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize a Repository:} To start using Git, you first need to initialize a new repository in your project directory.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    git init
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Add and Commit Changes:} After making changes to your files, you can add them to the staging area and commit them to the repository.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    git add .
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Create and Switch Branches:} To work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch and switch to it.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    git checkout -b new-feature
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Merge Branches:} Once your changes are complete, merge them back into the main branch.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    git checkout main
    git merge new-feature
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Push and Pull Changes:} Share your changes with others by pushing them to a remote repository or pull changes from a remote repository to your local machine.
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    git push origin main
    git pull origin main
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Resolve Conflicts:} If there are conflicts between branches during a merge, resolve them manually by editing the affected files and committing the changes.
\end{enumerate}

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that code changes are regularly integrated and tested, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the deployment of validated changes to production environments, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of errors.
\end{itemize}


By investing time and effort in skill development upfront, I was better equipped to tackle the challenges of the project as it progressed.


\section{Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing}

Regular meetings, brainstorming sessions, and peer reviews were conducted to exchange insights, discuss findings, and address any questions or uncertainties. This collaborative approach fostered a supportive learning environment where we could leverage each other’s expertise and experiences to accelerate our learning curve and collectively drive the project forward.

\subsection{Prototyping and Proof of Concepts}

The Prototyping and Proof of Concept phase is a pivotal step in the development journey, especially when working on complex backend systems. This phase allows for the validation of the technical feasibility and viability of the project’s solution before committing to full-scale development. Let’s delve into the details of how this phase unfolded:

\subsection{Defining Scope and Objectives}

The first task was to clearly define the scope and objectives of the prototype application. This involved identifying the core features and functionalities necessary to achieve the project’s goals. Key components such as API endpoint consolidation, event-driven processing with Kafka, integration with monitoring tools like Grafana and Kibana, and performance optimization were outlined as essential elements to include.

\subsection{Designing Mockups and Wireframes}

With the scope and objectives in mind, the next step was to visualize the user interface and experience of the prototype application. Mockups and wireframes were created using design tools or simple pen and paper to outline the layout, navigation flow, and interaction patterns of key screens and components. These visual representations served as a blueprint for the development process and facilitated communication and alignment throughout the project.

Collaboration and knowledge sharing played a crucial role during this phase. Regular meetings were held to review the progress of the prototype development, brainstorm ideas for improvements, and gather feedback from team members. Peer reviews were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the design mockups and wireframes, ensuring that they accurately represented the intended user experience and met the project objectives.

By engaging in collaborative discussions and leveraging the diverse expertise within the team, we were able to refine the scope and objectives of the prototype application, validate its technical feasibility through proof of concepts, and design an intuitive user interface that met the needs of our target audience. This collaborative approach not only accelerated our learning curve but also fostered a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for the success of the project.


\section{Solution}

To address this issue, we redesigned the flow to incorporate asynchronous processing. In the new architecture, the incoming requests are directed to a newly created API. This API then publishes an event to a message broker. Subscriptions within this message broker are configured to handle the asynchronous processing of these events by invoking the existing Service A API.
\\\\
\noindent Previously, there were multiple APIs being called directly. This has been consolidated into a single API that accepts a JSON object as input. Based on an attribute within this JSON object, the event is published to a specific topic. Consumers subscribed to these topics will then call the appropriate existing APIs asynchronously.
\\\\
\noindent To optimize the message broker's configuration and ensure efficient handling of the request load, we made the following adjustments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Max.Tasks.Count}: Defines the number of consumers for a topic. This value is limited by the number of partitions, with the default being one partition and one consumer.
    \item \textbf{Consumer.Override.Max.Poll.Records}: Specifies the number of records a consumer fetches and processes in one poll cycle.
    \item \textbf{Max.Requests.In.Flight}: Determines how many requests a consumer sends out simultaneously, with additional fetched records held in an in-memory buffer.
\end{itemize}

By adjusting these configurations, we were able to balance the load and improve the responsiveness of the system, ensuring that it could handle the increased volume of requests without performance degradation.

\end{figure}


\section{Backend Development}

Backend development serves as the backbone of our system, facilitating the management of business logic, data handling, and communication between the frontend interface and the database. Here's a breakdown of the different aspects of backend development in our project:

\subsection{Setup and Configuration}

The journey into backend development commences with the setup and configuration of our development environment. Leveraging Java as the core programming language and Spring Boot for rapid application development, we initialize the necessary frameworks and tools required for our project. Additionally, we integrate PostgreSQL for robust database solutions and Git for version control to ensure efficient collaboration and code management throughout the development lifecycle.

\subsection{Database Design and Modeling}

A pivotal aspect of backend development involves designing and modeling the database schema. Utilizing Spring Data JPA in conjunction with Hibernate, we define database models using Java entities, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries. We meticulously design the database schema, considering factors such as data relationships, normalization, and performance optimization. Furthermore, we employ Spring Data JPA's migration system to efficiently manage database schema changes, ensuring seamless data integrity and consistency.

\subsection{API Development}

With the database schema established, we proceed to develop robust APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to expose functionality to the frontend interface and external clients. Leveraging Spring Boot's powerful REST support, we define RESTful API endpoints for various resources in the application. These endpoints handle incoming HTTP requests, perform data validation, process business logic, and return appropriate HTTP responses in JSON format. Our APIs are meticulously designed to be consistent, predictable, and well-documented, facilitating seamless integration with frontend components and external systems.

\subsection{Business Logic Implementation}

Backend development encompasses the implementation of core business logic, including data processing, validation, and manipulation. Leveraging Java's robust ecosystem and Spring's dependency injection, we write functions and methods to manage user input, enforce business rules, and orchestrate interactions between different components of the system. Our business logic is encapsulated within Spring components, ensuring modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase.

\subsection{Authentication and Authorization}

Security is paramount in backend development, particularly concerning user authentication and authorization. Leveraging Spring Security's comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms, we secure our application against unauthorized access and malicious attacks. We configure authentication backends, define user models, and implement access controls to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources. Additionally, we leverage Spring Security's features such as CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and password hashing to mitigate common security vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Testing and Debugging}

Thorough testing and debugging are integral throughout the backend development process to identify and rectify any issues or bugs. We employ JUnit and Mockito for Java testing and Spring's testing framework to develop unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the functionality and reliability of backend components. Test-driven development (TDD) practices are employed to ensure that code changes undergo comprehensive testing before deployment to production. Additionally, we utilize debugging tools and techniques such as logging, error tracking, and remote debugging to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently, ensuring the stability and performance of the backend system.

\subsection{Deployment and Scalability}

Upon completion of backend development, we prepare for deployment and scalability of the application. We configure deployment environments using Kubernetes for container orchestration and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery, establishing robust CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Leveraging AWS for hosting the application, we ensure scalability, reliability, and availability. Additionally, we monitor application performance using Grafana for monitoring and alerting, track usage metrics, and implement scaling strategies such as horizontal scaling or auto-scaling to accommodate increased traffic and workload.

\subsection{File Processing System Configuration}

To efficiently process high volumes of data, we configured our system akin to real-time data streaming solutions like Amazon Kinesis and Apache Flink. This configuration allows for the effective processing of large files by breaking down the data into individual records and processing them asynchronously. The system ensures high throughput and low latency by leveraging Kafka for event streaming, enabling us to process millions of records with robust error handling and retry mechanisms. By adjusting Kafka consumer configurations such as `max.poll.records` and `max.requests.in.flight`, we optimized the balance between load processing and system responsiveness, ensuring smooth and efficient data handling.

\section{Integration and Testing}

Integration and testing play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, functionality, and performance of our system. In this section, we outline the integration of backend components and the various testing strategies employed to validate our application.

\subsection{Integration of Backend Components}

The integration of backend components involves seamlessly combining individual modules, services, and APIs to form a cohesive system. Leveraging the Spring framework's dependency injection and inversion of control, we integrate backend components such as controllers, services, repositories, and external APIs. In addition to Spring, we also utilize Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, for integrating external APIs.
\\\\
\noindent Retrofit simplifies the process of communicating with RESTful APIs by allowing us to define the API endpoints and request parameters as Java interfaces. It handles the conversion of JSON responses to Java objects and provides robust support for error handling and network operations. With Retrofit, we can efficiently consume APIs and incorporate external functionality into our backend system.
\\\\
\noindent By adhering to established design patterns and architectural principles, such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and the Repository pattern, we ensure loose coupling and high cohesion between components. This architectural approach facilitates easier maintenance, scalability, and extensibility of our backend system. The use of Retrofit for API integration complements these principles by providing a seamless and efficient mechanism for communicating with external services.

\subsection{Unit Testing}

Unit testing is a fundamental aspect of our testing strategy, focusing on the validation of individual units or components in isolation. Using JUnit and Mockito frameworks for Java testing, we develop unit tests to verify the correctness of methods, functions, and classes within our backend components. By simulating different scenarios and edge cases, we ensure that each unit behaves as expected and adheres to specified requirements. Unit tests are automated and executed frequently during the development process, providing rapid feedback and identifying regressions early in the lifecycle.

\subsection{Integration Testing}

Integration testing is a critical phase in our testing strategy, focusing on evaluating the interactions and dependencies between integrated backend components. It ensures that these components function cohesively as a unified system, providing confidence in the stability and interoperability of the integrated solution.
\\\\
\noindent We leverage the Spring framework's testing capabilities, specifically the MockMVC module, for integration testing. MockMVC allows us to simulate HTTP requests and responses, enabling comprehensive testing of controllers and their interactions with other components. Additionally, we utilize the REST Assured library, which provides a fluent API for testing RESTful APIs, to validate the communication between our backend services and external dependencies.
\\\\
\noindent Our integration tests encompass a wide range of scenarios, including end-to-end user journeys, error handling, and data flow validation. By simulating API requests and responses, we verify the correctness of data transmission, authentication mechanisms, and response formats. This ensures that our system behaves as expected under various conditions and gracefully handles errors and edge cases.
\\\\
\noindent In summary, integration testing plays a crucial role in validating the interoperability and functionality of our integrated backend components. By leveraging MockMVC and REST Assured, we can comprehensively test the communication between components and ensure the reliability and robustness of our system.


\subsection{Performance Testing}

Performance testing is essential for evaluating system responsiveness, scalability, and resource utilization, particularly in handling individual records from uploaded files and making API calls for each record. Our approach, resembling real-time data streaming systems like Amazon Kinesis or Apache Flink, focuses on measuring the latency of processing individual records, especially the 99th percentile (P99) requests. This metric provides insight into typical latency, helping us understand system performance under normal conditions.
\\\\
\noindent To conduct performance testing, we simulate file uploads with varying record counts and measure the time taken to process each record. We employ real-time monitoring and logging to capture and analyze API call latency for individual record processing. By adjusting the load and observing system response, we identify performance bottlenecks, scalability constraints, or areas needing optimization.

Our performance testing strategy includes the following key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Request Per Second (RPS) Measurement}: We track the number of requests processed by the system per second. This metric helps us understand the system's throughput and its ability to handle concurrent requests. By increasing the number of simulated file uploads and monitoring RPS, we can determine the system's maximum capacity and identify any throughput limitations.

    \item \textbf{Latency Analysis}: In addition to measuring the average latency, we focus on the P99 latency, which represents the time within which 99% of the requests are processed. This provides a more comprehensive view of the system's performance, highlighting any outliers that may affect the user experience. We also monitor other latency percentiles (e.g., P90, P95) to gain a broader understanding of system performance.

    \item \textbf{Resource Utilization Monitoring}: We continuously monitor system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk usage during performance testing. This helps us identify any resource bottlenecks that may impact the system's ability to handle high loads. By correlating resource utilization with performance metrics, we can pinpoint areas that require optimization.

    \item \textbf{Scalability Testing}: We evaluate the system's ability to scale horizontally and vertically by adding more processing nodes or increasing the capacity of existing nodes. This involves testing the system under varying loads to ensure it can handle increased traffic without degradation in performance.

    \item \textbf{Error Rate Tracking}: Monitoring the error rate during performance testing is crucial for identifying issues related to request handling. We track the number of failed requests and analyze the root causes to improve system reliability and robustness.

    \item \textbf{Real-Time Monitoring and Logging}: Utilizing tools such as Grafana and Kibana, we set up dashboards to visualize key performance metrics in real-time. This allows us to quickly identify and address performance issues as they arise. Detailed logs help us trace the flow of individual requests and diagnose problems effectively.

    \item \textbf{Iterative Optimization}: Performance testing is an ongoing process conducted throughout the development lifecycle. By iteratively testing and optimizing the system, we ensure that it meets the required performance criteria and can handle expected user traffic. This approach allows us to make incremental improvements and validate them against real-world scenarios.
\end{itemize}

Our iterative performance testing process occurs throughout development and before production deployment, ensuring the system meets performance criteria and can handle expected user traffic. Focusing on individual record processing latency, request per second, and other key performance metrics provides valuable insights for optimizing system performance and enhancing the user experience. This comprehensive approach ensures that our web application is robust, scalable, and capable of delivering a high-quality user experience even under heavy load conditions.

After release, ongoing monitoring and feedback mechanisms are established to track the effectiveness of fixes in production environments and identify any new issues or regressions that may arise. Continuous monitoring allows for proactive detection and resolution of issues, ensuring the stability and reliability of the web application over time.

\chapter{Conclusion}

\noindent This project successfully addressed the challenges of developing and optimizing a high-traffic API system for financial transactions. By leveraging comprehensive knowledge acquisition and targeted skill development, we established a solid foundation for the backend architecture, integrating robust technologies such as Kafka, Spring Boot, and Jenkins. This approach not only facilitated the handling of large volumes of requests but also ensured system responsiveness and reliability, crucial for financial applications.
\\\\
\noindent The implementation phase underscored the importance of meticulous backend development, including database design, API creation, and business logic integration. Through rigorous testing strategies—spanning unit, integration, performance, and user acceptance testing—we validated the system’s functionality and performance, ensuring it met stringent quality standards. Security measures were rigorously applied to protect sensitive financial data, reinforcing the system’s reliability and user trust.
\\\\
\noindent The deployment process, supported by CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes, ensured seamless and scalable production releases. Comprehensive documentation provided a vital resource for users and administrators, enhancing the system’s usability and maintainability. The iterative approach to bug fixing and continuous monitoring highlighted our commitment to long-term stability and performance. This project exemplifies a holistic and collaborative methodology in developing high-traffic API systems, setting a benchmark for future projects in similar domains.
